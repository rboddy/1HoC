    <h1>The First 1HoC</h1>

    <p>So this is the first 1 Hour of Code (1HoC) that I'm doing. I made a goal recently to write more code as part of my effor to learn more, so this is how I'm going to do it. I can spare an hour a day to write code. I know this isn't going to perfect and there will be days that I miss, but in general I'm going to strive to keep this up.</p>
    <p>So this page is the start. I'm going to be writing some technical stuff, and some simple stuff. Today I might keep it simple as an intro to the project. I already created a repo on GitHub where I'll put all of this. I probably won't do much branching or anything, just keep a master and use that.</p>

    <h2>The Code</h2>

    <p>Maybe today I'll practice some CSS Grid, shall we?</p>

    <div class="container">

        <div class="child1"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/rbonfb"><img src="https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/social-media-icons-the-circle-set/48/facebook_circle-512.png"/>></a></div>
        <div class="child2"><a href="http://www.twitter.com/imryanboddy"><img src="https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/logotypes/32/circle-twitter-512.png"/></a></div>
        <div class="child3"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanboddy/"><img src="https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/free-social-icons/67/linkedin_circle_black-512.png"/></a></div>
        <div class="child4"></div>
        <div class="child5"></div>
        <div class="child6"></div>

    </div>

    <p>So the above grid is what I came up with really quickly. It only took me 1 Google search because I was using grid-column instead of grid-template-column. I need to brush up on my grid stuff, because it is super powerful.</p>

    <p>I can't tell you how many times I've Googled how to center an image due to the fact that I keep forgeting that they are not block display by default. I need to remember that.</p>

    <p>Alright, so my hour is almost up. I refreshed my memory on CSS Grid a bit, and just wrote a basic HTML index page with some text and some CSS. Tomorrow maybe I'll finish up the grid. I don't like how the entire cell is clickable either, I just want the icon clickable, so I'll address that. I also want to make this starting page mobile responsive because if there's one thing I always need to practice it's responsivity.</p>
