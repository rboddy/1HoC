    <p>My name is Ryan Boddy and I wear many hats. I'm a Christian, a husband, a programmer, a release engineer, a cofounder, and much more. I'm 24 and I live in Fort Myers Florida with my beautiful wife Baylee. I grew up in Orlando Florida until I decided to go to Florida Gulf Coast University to get my bachelors in computer information systems. Since then I've stayed in the Fort working on a wide range of software products. I also cofounded an apparel company with my good friend Ben.

    <p>I'm a huge Star Wars nerd. I collect Star Wars Pop Vinyl bobbleheads along with other merch. I also love playing games like Destiny, Halo, Legend of Zelda, and many others. You can usually find me in my man cave playing some games or working on some code. I like developing mostly the front end of the stack for the most part but I'm always working towards honing my skills and becoming a full stack web developer. You can check out what I'm messing aorund with on my <a href="https://www.github.com/rboddy">Github</a>.</p>
