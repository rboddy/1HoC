    <p>Okay, it's day 2 so we're keeping this up despite the fact that I really want to go play some video games after a long day at work. That's okay, developing is an important skill to me and I want to keep it sharp!</p>
    
    <h2>The Code</h2>

    <p>Today we continue this little grid I started yesterday with CSS grid and fix some small issues I had with it. Hopefully. Let's dive in.</p>

    <div class="container">

    <p>Okay, so the basic grid itself is done. All nicely sized and centered icons. However, the whole cell in the grid is clickable, and I kind of just want the icon to be clickable. Let me see if I can achieve that, then if I have time I'll move on to mobile responsiveness.</p>

    <p>I just realized it has nothing to do with the anchor, it has to do with image resizing inside the anchor. I would usually just use the correct sized icons, but I had to dynamically resize them to save time. I'm going to skip this issue for now, the clickable cells isn't a big deal. The bigger deal is the mobile stuff, so I'm going to take a look at this in mobile and see how much better I could make it look. Then hopefully tomorrow I'll do some more grid stuff and maybe get to JavaScript! That would be nice.</p>

    <p>Alright, it didn't look terrible in mobile, but it could definitely look better. Time for a media query and some grid foolery.</p>

    <p>I didn't end up using grid foolery, I just did it all in the media query. Yeah it's hacky but I use media queries because they work. I'll do more research on this though. I know grid minmax is super helpful with mobile. That's my hour for today. I made some decent progress, but I'm going to go slay some adversaries in video games and relax. Until tomorrow.</p>
