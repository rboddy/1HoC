    <h1>1 HoC 4</h1>

    <input type="date" value="2018-06-15" disabled >
    
    <p>So I skipped a day in 1HoC. I knew it would happen eventually, but I just wanted to spend some time with my wife yesterday. This isn't some challenge to do something every day, it's a challenge to simply write more code. So let's get back to the leaderboard project.</p>

    <div id="leaderBoard">
        <div class="boardContainer">

            <div class="rank">{{ rank1 }}</div>
            <div class="cell1">{{ gamerTag1 }}</div>
            <div class="cell2">{{ glory1 }}</div>



            <div class="rank">{{ rank2 }}</div>
            <div class="cell1">{{ gamerTag2 }}</div>
            <div class="cell2">{{ glory2 }}</div>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The above grid is what I came up with for a grid built with CSS grid and vue.js to display crucible rankings for my Destiny 2 clan. I kept the design simple. I then said I would look in to the Destiny API to get stats. However, I ran in to a complication. It seems that a website can't send an API request, it has to be sent from a node server. I've never used node before unless it was rolled in to a framework, but I'm still going to try and take this on so I can learn something.</p>
