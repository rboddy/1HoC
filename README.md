I want to write 1 hour of code a day if I can. Whether that be in the morning or during my lunch hour, or before bed whatever. No particular language but this will probably be mostly front end stuff. Let's see what happens. Starting on June 11th, 2018.

Quick update on this project! I didn't end up doing every day but I'm coding much more now than I used to. This also rapidly turned in to the front end overhaul of my website, so once I'm done with that I will be doing more stuff with newer tech. Stuff like Vue.js, Meteor apps, and even some PoSh devops tools I've been conceptualizing!
